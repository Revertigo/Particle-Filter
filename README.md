# Overview
This project is an implementation of paritcle filter algorithm as part of Navigation Algorithms course.
The algorithm is used in the context of localization and tracking a moving object in a 2D space dimension.
The simulation (of the algorithm) shows how a collection of particles able to trace a "robot" based on measures from
landmarks and probability.
